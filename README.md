# Mood Color

Remember those funny mood rings our parents told use were stupid and fake. Well, of course they were right but I liked the colors and the idea nonetheless and wrote a little app that tells you what color represents your current mood. 
This is just a fun app that I built to keep practicing
# Technical

React along with Material-UI components were used to build the UX. Redux controls data flow.
